Welcome to the Introduction to Python Programming Course.  This
directory, <tt>PythonClass</tt>, is where you find support files
related to the class exercises.  It is also where you will be doing
your work.

<p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Exercises/index.html"><tt>Exercises/</tt></a> folder is where you
find all the class exercises.

<p>
<li>The <tt>Data/</tt> folder is where you find data files, scripts, and
other files used by the exercises.

<p>
<li>The <tt>Ext/</tt> folder contains files related to Python extension
programming.

<p>
<li>The <tt>Solutions</tt> folder contains complete solution code for
various exercises.   Please see the <a href="Solutions/README.html">README</a>
file in that directory for more details.

</ul>

<p>
We will be using a program known as IDLE to edit and run Python
programs.  In this folder, you will find a script
called <tt>RunIDLE</tt>.  On Windows, you can just double-click on
this file and IDLE will start.  On Macintosh, you will want to run
this from a terminal by going into the <tt>PythonClass/</tt> folder and
then typing <tt>python RunIDLE.pyw</tt>.

<p>
If you need to download Python for some reason, it can be obtained at
<a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>.

<h3>Some Rules of the Road</h3>


<ol>
<li>Every program that you create <b>MUST</b> be placed in the top
level <tt>PythonClass</tt> folder (the same folder where this
README file was found).  <b>NO EXCEPTIONS</b>

<p>
<li>You will <b>NOT</b> create any file or program in any folder
or directory other than the top level <tt>PythonClass</tt> folder 
(see rule 1).

<p>
<li>If you are still inclined to create programs in any folder other
than the <tt>PythonClass</tt> folder, you will refer to Rule 1
and Rule 2 above.

<p>
<li>You will ask for help at the first sign of any problem with
your machine, IDLE, or Python.   

<p>
<li>Some exercises are more difficult than others.  However, solutions
are provided for <b>ALL</b> class exercises.  There is no excuse for not
having working code--cut and paste from the solution if you have to.

<p>
<li>You will <b>EXACTLY</b> follow the filename conventions listed in each
exercise.  That is, if the exercise asks you to create a program
called <tt>spam.py</tt>, you will create a program called <tt>spam.py</tt>,
not <tt>spam2.py</tt>,<tt>spammy.py</tt>, or <tt>processedmeat.py</tt>.

<p>
<li>If you have never used Python before, you will edit and run all
programs using IDLE.  You will not use any other editor such as 
vi, emacs, vim, pico, Eclipse, Textmate, or Windows Notepad.

</ul>
